# Cantor Pro MX Keyboard

Cantor Pro MX is based on the Cantor Pro Frood, which is in turn based on the original Cantor Keyboard by Diego Palacios, with the following modifications:

* Uses [42. Keebs Frood](https://42keebs.eu/shop/parts/controllers/frood-rp2040-pro-micro-controller/) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/piit79/Frood)) RP2040-based controller instead of the Black Pill. Still with no diodes!
* It is a bit narrower thanks to the smaller controller
* Uses Kailh MX hotswap sockets
* Supports RGB underglow (6x WS2812B / SK6812 5050)
* Has holes for standoffs for use with a PCB switch plate or [layered acrylic case](https://github.com/piit79/cantor/tree/main/case/cantor-pro-mx)

Cantor Pro MX kit is available for purchase at [42. Keebs](https://42keebs.eu/shop/kits/pro-micro-based/cantor-pro-mx-40-hotswap-split-ergo-kit/).
