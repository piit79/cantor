# Cantor Pro Keyboard

Cantor Pro is based on the original Cantor Keyboard with the following modifications:

* Uses Kailh Choc V1 hotswap sockets
* Has holes for standoffs for use with a [PCB switch plate](https://github.com/piit79/cantor/tree/main/pcb-switch-plate) or [acrylic switch/bottom plates](https://github.com/piit79/cantor/tree/main/case)

Cantor Pro kit is available for purchase at [42. Keebs](https://42keebs.eu/shop/kits/pro-micro-based/cantor-pro-40-low-profile-hotswap-split-ergo-kit/).
