# Cantor Pro Frood Keyboard

Cantor Pro Frood is based on the original Cantor Keyboard by Diego Palacios, with the following modifications:

* Uses [42. Keebs Frood](https://42keebs.eu/shop/parts/controllers/frood-rp2040-pro-micro-controller/) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/piit79/Frood)) RP2040-based controller instead of the Black Pill. Still with no diodes!
* Thanks to the smaller controller it is a bit narrower
* Uses Kailh Choc V1 hotswap sockets
* Has holes for standoffs for use with a [PCB switch plate](https://github.com/piit79/cantor/tree/main/pcb-switch-plate) or [acrylic switch/bottom plates](https://github.com/piit79/cantor/tree/main/case)

Cantor Pro Frood kit is available for purchase at [42. Keebs](https://42keebs.eu/shop/kits/pro-micro-based/cantor-pro-frood-40-low-profile-hotswap-split-ergo-kit/).
