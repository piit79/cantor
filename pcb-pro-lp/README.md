# Cantor Pro LP Keyboard

Cantor Pro LP (formerly known as Cantor Pro Frood) is based on the original Cantor Keyboard by Diego Palacios, with the following modifications:

* Supports more modern controllers instead of the Black Pill:
    * [42. Keebs Frood](https://42keebs.eu/shop/parts/controllers/frood-rp2040-pro-micro-controller/) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/piit79/Frood)) RP2040-based controller
    * [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) controller for a **wireless build**
* Adds battery contacts and a power switch
* It is a bit narrower thanks to the smaller controller
* Uses Kailh Choc V1 hotswap sockets
* Supports RGB underglow using 6x WS2812B / SK6812 5050 RGB modules
* Has holes for standoffs for use with a PCB switch plate or a [layered acrylic case](https://github.com/piit79/cantor/tree/main/case/cantor-pro-lp)
